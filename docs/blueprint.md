# **App Name**: Recipe Snap

## Core Features:

- Ingredient Identification: Analyze uploaded photos of ingredients to identify them. This tool needs to determine if a photo contains food or not.

- Content Display: Display identified ingredients and generated recipes in a user-friendly format, including titles and summaries.
- Photo Upload: Implement a photo upload feature that will use the device camera or photo library.
